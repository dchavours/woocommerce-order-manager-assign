To populate said array

How do I get the blocks and what exactly are the blocks?
Why don't I just echo out the params which are being used in the other function?

Okay, so I'm in a good spot because I know payment method which is a good way of checking if they have paid or not but I'm having
a hard time STILL with getting values of customer_booking_start and customer_booking_end.
